            <strong>Medical Emergency</strong>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr" >
            <span>Patients with serious medical emergencies should go to the nearest Emergency Department. 
            Our Clinic is not equipped to handle medical emergencies.</span>

            <strong>Documentation Requirements</strong>
        </p>
         <p dir="ltr" >
            <span>On your first visit to Citrus Medical Centre – or your first visit for a new service – 
            it is required that you fill out an intake form. All patients must bring and present a valid OHIP card to 
            ALL medical visits. Residents of other provinces are unfortunately not covered by the Ontario government, 
            a valid Ontario health card is required. A fee of $100 for a regular medical visit for all non-Ontario residents 
            must be paid prior to seeing the doctor. Additional charges may apply. Official receipts are provided.</span>

            <strong>No-Show Policy and Lateness Policy</strong>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr" >
            <span>In order to provide efficient services to all patients, Citrus Medical Centre strictly enforces a fee 
            for any no-show or late patients (fee is variable depending on appointment type $40+). This ensures that we 
            can provide quality and timely services to all patients as efficiently as possible. If it is your first time 
            utilizing a service, please arrive early to fill out any necessary forms.</span>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>We require 24 hour notice for all cancelled or re-scheduled appointments to avoid incurring a no-show fee. 
            Cancelled or re-scheduled appointments must be done during regular business hours with one of our friendly staff 
            members. We are unable to accept such requests via answering service or email.</span>
        </p>
        <p>If you book within the 24 hour time frame, the policy is in effect immediately.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>All appointments will end at the scheduled time so that we may serve the next patient at their scheduled start time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Due to the high volume of demand for medical services, late comers may be required to re-schedule for the same 
        or a later day and appropriate charges for the late or missed appointment may apply.</p>   
        <p dir="ltr">
            <strong>Phone Calls or Email</strong>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>Due to OHIP regulations and privacy concerns, we are unable to offer any medical advice or management 
            over the phone, fax or via email. Patients are advised to take advantage of our advanced access scheduling 
            system for the next available appointment.</span>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>Communication with administrative staff about your health or investigations is also against provincial 
            privacy regulations and you will be instructed to communicate all medical concerns with your doctor at your appointment. 
            Our staff will be happy to help with all other concerns.</span>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <strong>Laboratory Tests or Investigations</strong>
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>Most test results will arrive to our office within 7 days of being performed. They will arrive directly to the 
            Physician who ordered them. Patients are requested to book a follow-up appointment with the same physician who ordered 
            their test to be advised of the results and management. If patients are concerned, curious, or still having symptoms while 
            waiting for test results, patients are encouraged to take advantage of our open scheduling system for the next available 
            appointment with the ordering physician.</span>
        </p>   
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>Administrative and nursing staff do not have access to your file and thus will not be able to confirm if your 
            test results have arrived nor the results of your tests. Please book an appointment 7 days after the test is performed to 
            review your results with your doctor.</span>
        </p>   
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>While we attempt to contact all individuals with abnormal or concerning results; do not assume that no call is 
            good news. All results should be reviewed with the ordering physician 7 days after being performed.</span>
        </p>   
        <p dir="ltr">
            <strong>Uninsured Medical Services</strong>
        </p>   
        <p dir="ltr">
            <span>All charges for uninsured services must be settled at point of service.</span>
            <span>Receipts will be provided so that you may submit your claim for reimbursement from your insurance provider.</span>
